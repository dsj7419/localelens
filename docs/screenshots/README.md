# Screenshots

Screenshots for the README gallery. Capture after generating real outputs.

## Required Screenshots

| Filename | Description |
| `demo-flow-placeholder.png` | Animated GIF or hero image showing the workflow |
| `homepage-placeholder.png` | Landing page with project list |
| `mask-editor-placeholder.png` | MaskCanvas with brush tool active |
| `results-placeholder.png` | VariantViewer showing drift inspector |
| `montage-placeholder.png` | 2×2 grid export showing all locales |

## Capture Instructions

1. Run the app with generated outputs
2. Use browser DevTools to set viewport to 1280×800
3. Capture each screen at the appropriate workflow step
4. Optimize images (use TinyPNG or similar)
5. Replace placeholder references in README.md

## Naming Convention

Keep the `-placeholder` suffix until real screenshots are captured. This makes it easy to find and replace all placeholders with a single search.
